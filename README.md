## Important instructions
- **python version should be *latest***

## Technologies used :
### Language 
- *Python*- for programming and writing logic.
  
### Python libraries 
-   numpy,random,tensorflow,nltk,pickle,keras .
### Models 
- Machine Learning Models such as keras ,tensorflow and nltk.
## Working of the app :
### Import libraries and dataset.
- First of all,import all the required modules and libraries of python.
- Then, the json file is loaded to obtain dataset.
- We combined our datasets of true and fake and we removed all the Null vaules.
- Then we preprocessed the dataset.
- Then different machine learning algorithms were applied .

### Adding functionality : features
> - **NumPy**- *It is  a Python package used for performing the various numerical computations and processing of the multidimensional and single-dimensional array elements.*
> - **Random**: *Facilitates random number generation, sampling, and probability distributions, crucial for various applications such as simulations, statistical analysis, and machine learning.*
> - **TensorFlow**: *Offers a comprehensive framework for building and training machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, with flexibility, scalability, and extensive tooling support.*
> - **NLTK**: *Provides a suite of libraries and programs for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, aiding in text analysis and understanding.*
> - **Pickle**: *Allows serialization and deserialization of Python objects, enabling the saving and loading of data structures and models, vital for storing and transferring complex data across sessions or systems.*
> - **Keras**: *Simplifies the creation and experimentation of deep learning models by providing a high-level API with user-friendly interfaces and seamless integration with TensorFlow, enabling rapid prototyping and development.*
